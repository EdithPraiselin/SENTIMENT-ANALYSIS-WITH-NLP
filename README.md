**DESCRIPTION**: This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression. The dataset consists of positive and negative reviews stored in separate folders. The data is loaded, labeled, and preprocessed by cleaning text (removing punctuation, numbers, and converting to lowercase). Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) visualizes sentiment distribution. The text is then transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF, and a Logistic Regression model is trained to classify reviews as positive or negative. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and a confusion matrix, providing insights into its effectiveness.
